            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a pretence unto the immediate enjoyment of <note place="margin">Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> the Spirit of God, as alone the onely All-ſufficient means to the Soul, even for all intents and purpoſes, eſpecially, for Evidence.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a pretence, <hi>Viz.</hi> As oppoſed to that, that is true and reall; or ſo indeed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The fallacy, and formality of the Errour, lies hid in the words, Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, as alone, Means, as they have
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114638:14"/> their place and ſenſe in this Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Immediate, that is not to be taken in oppoſition to diſtance of place, but to the meanes of enjoying: But this word Immediate, will be better clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if we will joyne it with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond terme of fallacy mentioned, as alone.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As alone, without the uſe of any means, whatever ſubordinate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. Thus whatſoever we can call Religious helps, Goſpell means, though owned and ordained by God himſelf, is plainly excluded this their Canaan, as imperfect, or a very needleſs thing, and all uſe thereof flatly condemned as a living and reſting below God; and <note place="margin">Of falſe reſts, which is wholly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Treatiſe.</note> therefore oftentimes compared in his Book, to the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Wilderneſſe. In a word, it pretends to be in the Sunne, and holds the beames in contempt, trodden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot.</p>
               <p>It is in an everlaſting Light, and hath caſt a vaile of darkeneſſe upon theſe things below it, <hi>Viz.</hi> Ordinances, Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Scriptures, Experiences; and not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114638:14"/> onely upon thoſe meanes, but upon Chriſt Jeſus the Mediatour himſelfe. Theſe are forms, types, ſhadowes, while it is ſwallowed up in the Power, Truth, Subſtance, God, its glorious Heaven.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Means, it is not ſaid, Efficient' nor yet End; I adviſe the Reader to take ſpeciall notice of both thoſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The queſtion is not, whether the Spirit of God be not as alone, the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly All-ſufficient, Efficient of all in the Soul of a Creature: Here we diſſent not, but ſubſcribe with both hands to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>That it is God that worketh in us both to will, and to doe of his own good pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither is the queſtion here, whether God as alone, be the onely All-ſufficient End of the Soul; in this we agree: <hi>For God is our Portion for ever.</hi> Nothing below God, nothing but God, is the reſt of Souls in this ſenſe. The ſound of this moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent terme, namely, Reſt, is ſo equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and dubious, that the weaker Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had in a moſt eſpeciall manner, need to retain this Item, That we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovert
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114638:15"/> not about the Finall reſt of our Souls, but the means thereof: not about our Objective, but our Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall reſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Therefore the Spirit here, is to be underſtood as means, or as the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of all means to the Soul; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, we cannot call the Spirit means, but in an unuſuall, and improper ſenſe; yet we can no way better, if any way otherwiſe, expreſſe their ſenſe, who prefer, I am ſure, and recommend their Spirit, in ſtead both of the cauſe, and means alſo.</p>
               <p>3. To all intents and purpoſes, it ſtands in the room of all the means, both of knowledge and grace, but eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of comfort, all our uſuall and moſt comfortable Evidences of the truth of our grace, Gods love, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to, and preſence in us, theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially are moſt ſuſpicious, and forcibly beat back with an high &amp; zealous Arm out of this their reſt. This Errour will tell you, that Chriſt in us hath this Prerogative to be immediately <hi>(i. e.)</hi> without, and above the uſe of any means, both the Spirit of Truth, Grace,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114638:15"/> and Comfort; even All in All unto its ſubject: It pretends to the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate injoyment of God, as alone the onely All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient meanes to the Soul, even to all intents and purpoſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>The Doctrine of the firſt of theſe kinds, namely, touching Evidences, wherein the Holy Ghoſt is made to oppoſe its own effect in us, brancheth it ſelf into theſe two Aſſertions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That no Qualification of the Creature, whatever, can be, or may be, uſed as a ſufficient Evidence of Gods Love or Preſence: this as the intelligent Reader may finde, is the ſenſe of the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 15. falſ Reſts.</p>

               <p>The queſtion is, whether God can juſtly take away that Grace, that he himſelf by the ſpeciall operation of the ſpirit hath given.

               <p>1. Theſe outward gifts and mercies, are given as but <hi>Exhypotheſi,</hi> we break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the condition, as we have forfeited, ſo are we lyable to give them up, at the owners pleaſure and demand. But
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114638:25"/> God hath ingaged himſelf, never total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take away Grace, and therefore lawfully without breach of Bond, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it.</p>
               <p>Now this Engagement is Reall, and Vertuall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. God hath properly Engaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Bargain with Chriſt, not to recall the gift of Grace from his, Chriſt loved us, and gave himſelf for us, that he might Redeem us from our vain converſation, to be a holy People, even with the price of his life and blood: God accepted, Juſtice is ſatisfied, by his ſtripes we are healed, the bargain ended; it was then, <note place="margin">Iſai. 53.</note> as we may read, concluded; That by this knowledge, or by the acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf, he ſhould juſtifie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Now the price being tendred and received, the property of the goods is altered. Can God in Juſtice now, (for Juſtice is ſatisfied) reclaim our Grace, ours not onely by gift, but purchaſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? <note place="margin">1 Tim. 2. 6.

               <p>Secondly, as God properly Engaged <note place="margin">Jer. 32. 40.</note>
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:114638:25"/> by bargain, not to take away Grace, ſo by Promiſe alſo. Hath not God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <note place="margin">Deut. 26. 18.</note> and moſt ſolemnly Covenanted, <hi>That he will put his feare into our hearts?</hi> and to what end and effect? Even that we ſhould be kept thereby, from falling away, that we ſhall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part ftom him: <hi>For the gifts of God are without repentance,</hi> yea, let this add to our great comfort, <hi>That he will not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. There is likewiſe a Vertuall En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, whereby God is bound ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to withdraw his Spirit and Grace from his; which is an addition of ſtrength to the Engagement of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, to hold God to his Word. The Spirit and Grace is not onely the token of Gods love, but a Pledge to ſupply Chriſts abſence; and our ſecurity for our

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114638:26"/> and Holineſſe he hath once given us. Now certainly, if God cannot lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he cannot at all take away Grace, <note place="margin">1 Joh. 1. 9.</note> if he cannot <hi>De Jure,</hi> he will not <hi>De Facto,</hi> who is <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Faithfull; Juſt,</hi> with relation to our <hi>Saviours Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>To conclude, then Grace is no falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidence upon this account, it is neither changeable in it ſelf, nor yet with reſpect to Gods diſpoſall.</p>
               <p>But were it ſo, that our Grace were at the owners diſpoſall? what advantage yet is gained to this way of the Spirit by ſuch a grant? Is not Gods Spirit as much Gods own as our Grace? We read of our Light, our Grace; but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of any ſuch or ſo clear an intereſt we have in the Spirit: is Grace, Gods right, and not much rather the Spirit? Is Grace in Gods Power, Will, Diſpoſal, and the Spirit wholly in ours? cannot God ſuck in his own <hi>Breath,</hi> as eaſily as to blot or put out our <hi>Life?</hi> hath not God the ſame, (if not more immediate) Power, over the Cauſe as effect? Yet this is the way wherein we muſt walke

                  </label> Suppoſe we grant, yet what weight will it add to the ſcale in hand: The queſtion is not whether there may not be ſome Caſes experienced, wherein Grace cannot evidence, but whether Grace is not able and apt in it ſelfe to Evidence, or whether it be not lawfull to reflect upon our Grace, to clear our Evidence for Heaven.</p>
               <p>2. For further ſatisfaction, let us a little weigh this caſe, in the ballance of Experience; and we ſhall finde that as there is a two-fold deſertion, namely, of Grace and Comfort, ſo theſe ſeldome or never fall in together to the ſame perſon; for where we finde an Ebb of Grace, we uſually find a Flood of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence; and we many times ſee Streams of Grace flowing from the wounded bleeding Conſcience.</p>
               <p>The Spirit is called <hi>Fire,</hi> and it doth many times give much heat and little
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114638:27"/> light; when it hath denied to bring with it the <hi>Light</hi> of Gods Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet it hath been as a Refiners fire, to purge the Soul to burn up its luſt, and to take away droſſe and Tinn.</p>
               <p>So that very many, even while they do miſerably labour under ſuch ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of Comfort, they are zealouſly affected to the glory of God, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of Chriſt, the comforts of the Spirit, and doe even hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſſe: But to apply, If the deſertion be of Comfort, as is moſt agreeable to the Caſe in hand, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that all ſincerity and fear of God is never ſo farre gone, even under the greateſt deſertion of Comfort, as not to be diſcernable even by the Soul it ſelf that ſuffers, if Enlightned, aſſiſted by the Spirit, the Comforter: doe not all the expreſſions of Spirits ſo laboring experience ſo much, and teſtifie for them to all the hearers, their fear to offend their prizing of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But admit the deſertion be of Grace, as it is ſad to think how far even thoſe that are truely in Chriſt, may fall; ſo is it as hard to imagine, how a perſon
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114638:28"/> while under the ſtate of Apoſtacy, ſhould ever have ſo ſerious a ſelf-refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as to have any occaſion to make uſe of his Evidences; tis all one to him, while he lies in this ſtate, whether they be clear or blur'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">

                  <hi>But ſuppoſe him new enlightned, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convicted; then he will have need of Evidences, and finde none.</hi>

                  </label> As ſuch light brings Conviction with it, ſo ſuch Conviction brings light with it; I mean, <hi>matter of Evidence and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort:</hi> For if a man be ſo far humbled as to queſtion his condition, and to bring himſelf to Triall, and ſo to Conviction; this is undoubtedly a good, viſible, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernable mark in the light of the Spirit, even of the true enjoyment of God.</p>
               <p>So that we ſee it nothing avails ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to our Caſe, or indeed to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to Object, that Grace may not be viſible, and ſo not Evidentiall.</p>
               <p>But let us obſerve two things by the by.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Change with reſpect to Comfort, is not in our Grace, but in the Spirits preſence or abſence.</p>

               <p> Secondly, not in his ſpirit, becauſe of diſtance in natures: to me, and yet I humbly ſubmit to higher apprehenſions, yet to me this ſeemes defended by the hand of ſound and upright reaſon: the preſence of Chriſt in his Spirit is of too ſubtil and ſpiritual a nature to fal under, or any way to bediſcerned by ſuch groſs <note place="margin">This is largly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.</note> and carnall Creatures, as the Sons of men, but by and through a <hi>medium,</hi> I mean, its <hi>effects,</hi> is any thing that comes under the name of Spirit immediatly, or in it ſelf decernable to us?

Now the Spirit of the Lord, is that <hi>pure Spirit,</hi> infinitely far more pure Spirit: the very name of ſpirit being groſſe and carnall, with reſpect thereto: how ſhall we then judge of that immediately?

               <p>BEfore, we have reconciled the Spirit, and its effects, our gracious quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties infuſed by it.

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114638:47"/> with regard to its Perſon and Office. Firſt, the Perſon of Chriſt is the cauſe of the perſon of the Spirit, by <hi>deriva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> the Spirit being the joynt <hi>breath and iſſue</hi> both of the Father and <hi>Son.</hi> Secondly, the Perſon of Chriſt is the cauſe of the <hi>Office</hi> of the Spirit: firſt, by <hi>merit,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2.

               <p>Yet this their ſpirit (and the Spirit of God by them ſo called) how ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wicked; doth even <hi>ſtab</hi> at Chriſt himſelf, with theſe two erroneous <hi>Points:</hi> namely,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Perſon of Chriſt is but a form, type, or ſhadow onely, or a bare repreſentation of the Spirit at his coming: as the types and ſhadows of the Law were before of the coming of Chriſt.</hi> See falſe reſts in <hi>pag.</hi> 103, 104.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That Chriſt is not to be the object or Medium of Faith,</hi> (i.) <hi>We are not to believe on Chriſt as our Mediator and Saviour.</hi> See the fifteenth falſe reſt.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe the <hi>Seekers</hi> own; but the laſt is the very dregs of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſme;</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:114638:48"/> which affirms, that Chriſt came not among men to procure <hi>ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> but to be an Object of <hi>imitation</hi> to <hi>men.</hi>

               <p n="1">1. The ſpirit as a ſpirit of praier, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to pray, either before praier, or in our praying.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Spirit teacheth us <hi>how to pray, before</hi> we pray by preparing our hearts
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:114638:78"/> to praier, by <hi>meanes</hi> and by <hi>degrees;</hi> by bringing unto us the knowledge of our <hi>eſtates, wants, the mercy and fulneſſe of God,</hi> by the <hi>word,</hi> the Law and Goſpel, and by its daily increaſing this <hi>habit</hi> of praier by daily <hi>acts;</hi>

               <p>But as our Spirits are <hi>ſuſpitious, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtionable,</hi> ſo only we judge of, and

The Law being not made for a righteous man:</hi> Yet if a righteous man fall under the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of Suſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Law muſt try and <hi>cleere</hi> him. He is not tried for <hi>judgment</hi> but <hi>ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> he is not tried as a <hi>good</hi> and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous man, but as one that is <hi>feared,</hi> doubted, to be an <hi>evill doer.</hi> The Law being made for man and not man for the Law, it is inferiour to him, yea, even his ſervant in this reſpect, as it ſerveth to try and judge of ſuſpitious and doubted men. No more is the <hi>word a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> but a <hi>Servant</hi> to the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> as it is the <hi>Judge and Triall of ſuſpitious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</hi> Moreover,</p>
               <p>2. The word doth never try any ſpirit in it <hi>ſelf</hi> but in its <hi>effects,</hi> it doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly therefore, not judge of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but as it trieth its effects and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of them: We finding our waies, our thoughts to be <hi>truth,</hi> conclude therefrom, that they are guided and acted by the <hi>ſpirit of truth,</hi> we by the Scriptures likewiſe, trying and meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring mens <hi>opinions</hi> and <hi>practiſes,</hi> do thus conſequently and accidentally only judge of the ſpirit.</p>

               <p> Laſtly, While we make the word of God the Judge and Triall of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> we try the <hi>ſpirit</hi> only by the <hi>word</hi> as its own effect, and whether it be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to judge of the <hi>fire,</hi> by its <hi>heat,</hi> the cauſe, by its <hi>effects,</hi> judge ye.</p>
               <p>Then this is the reſult and reſolution of the caſe, by making the word the triall of the ſpirits, we do no more abaſe or abuſe the Holy ſpirit of God, then we make the cauſe to ſtoop as inferiour to the effect, by cleering or proving it by the ſame; or then a righteous man is inſlaved by the Law, when as he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted to liberty by it.</p>
               <p>But ſomthing it behoveth us to ſpeak in defence of the affirmative part, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>That the Word of God, and holy <note place="margin">The affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative truth.</note> Scriptures, is the only Judg and triall of ſpirits, that is to ſay, To end all <hi>contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies, cleere the truth, diſcover Errour, and every falſe way.</hi> Which I argue,</p>
               <p>1. From the <hi>matter,</hi> thus, that which contains the Will of God muſt needs be the judge of, the triall of truth, and the decider of all Controverſie.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Holy Scriptures</hi> confeſſedly contain <hi>the Will of God.</hi>

               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:114638:82"/>
               <p> Therefore the holy Scriptures muſt needs be the Judge of ſpirits, the triall of truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond of theſe muſt needs be granted, even upon moſt <hi>immediate</hi> reaſon, God that is every way <hi>truth, that cannot ly,</hi> and ſpeak any thing that is not in his thought or Heart, his <hi>word</hi> muſt needs containe his <hi>mind</hi> and will.</p>
               <p>Now for the <hi>Conſequence</hi> in the firſt propoſition, <hi>viz. That which containes the Will of God muſt needs be the judg of ſpirits,</hi> triall of truth, Decider of all Controverſies, you have moſt eaſily the reaſon of it, by conſidering what it is, that the whol world of men do ſo much argue for, what that is, that is called and honored with the name of truth, by every mouth that ſpeaketh? Is it not that very thing which we call the <hi>Will and ſenſe of God</hi> in other words? what is our truth, the <hi>Helen</hi> for which the whole World is at debate, and varience; but the way the will, the <hi>virgin</hi> truth of Heaven? would we know who is true and who a lyar, <hi>let God be true and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man and ſpirit elſe a liar,</hi> his Word is <hi>truth,</hi> and the <hi>meaſure therefore of it.</hi>

I was alive once,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, without the Law, (i.)</hi> I counted my ſelfe of perfect vigor, life, and ſtrength, before the Law was brought cloſe upon me; before I knew what God required of me; <hi>but when the commandement came,</hi> I found my inability and weakneſſe, the ſtrength and glorying of ſin over me, which made me hide my head in ſhame and ſorrow; <hi>when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement came, ſin revived, and I dyed, Rom.</hi> 7. 9, 10.</p>

               <p n="2">2. And in order to the glory of grace on <hi>the Veſſells of honour,</hi> the commands of God upon them have a twofold end al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; <hi>one</hi> in this World, for their <hi>obedience (i.)</hi> to give them <hi>power,</hi> by the very command to obey the ſame, <hi>it being the power of God (i.)</hi> having the power of the ſpirit of God along with it, to make it ſucceſſefully command us to <hi>obedience.</hi> Thus the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>Christ is ſpirit and life,</hi> and he <hi>having the words of eternall life,</hi> while he calleth upon us, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt,</hi> he doth awaken us; and while he commandeth, <hi>Lazarus come forth, the dead</hi>

               <p>3. From the <hi>end</hi> of promiſes, as God himſelf hath <hi>declared</hi> it to be by his own authority in the holy Scriptures, and <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> it according to his truth and power in mans experiences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Gods own end in promiſing (that none might have the leaſt occaſion left, of ſo groſſe an errour) is almoſt every where found with his promiſe in Scripture. And what is it but the end we ſpeak of, reſt, quietneſſe, peace, contentation, <hi>&amp;c. Fear</hi>

               <p>Again, be <hi>contented with ſuch things as</hi>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:114638:106"/> you have, but upon what ground? <hi>for,</hi> or <hi>becauſe</hi> he hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave</hi>

                  <hi>nor forſake thee.</hi> Yea let us heare one famous Scripture, ſpeak for all the reſt: For God <hi>willing more abundantly, to ſhew unto the Heires of promiſe,</hi> the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity <hi>of his Councell, confirmed it by an Oath, that by two immutable things,</hi> (a <hi>promiſe</hi> being one of the two) <hi>in which it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong Conſolation.</hi> Heb. 6. 17. 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Experience</hi> ſtrongly proves the end of the promiſe to be ſuch as we ſpeak of: In that they have ſo conſtantly been, throughout all generations, effectuall good means of reſt, comfort, ſatisfaction, or eaſe in their application; we may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude theſe and ſuch like to be the <hi>ends</hi> thereof. Nothing being an able and effectuall <hi>means</hi> in any of the works of God but ſuch as are appointed and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate thereto by God himſelf: And the end of <hi>Execution</hi> ever diſcovering, revei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the end of <hi>intention</hi> in God, who <hi>worketh all things according to the councell</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Yea certaine it is, this way of a promiſe is a means of a <hi>morall</hi> and eternall efficacy
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:114638:107"/> to gvie hope, reſt, ſatisfaction, and the like.</p>
               <p>This way is <hi>regular</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> of right reaſon not being only the way of men, but God alſo. And may we not uſe the promiſes now, for the intents and purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, for which both <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture, nature and God</hi> hath appointed them? hath God ſent us <hi>glad tidings of great joy</hi> in a promiſe? and ſhall we not? muſt we not <hi>beleeve the Goſpell?</hi> and rejoyce therein? God hath made us pertakers of a <hi>better covenant,</hi> and muſt we not take comfort therefrom, becauſe it is eſtabliſhed upon <hi>better promiſes? Heb.</hi> 8. 6.</p>
               <p>Goſpell Chriſtians, <hi>are the Heires of the promiſes,</hi> they <hi>inherit the promiſes,</hi> and ſhall not the <hi>Heire</hi> rejoyce and be glad, with his rich Inheritance; <hi>ſit under his Vine and his Fig-tree ſinging Praiſes,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea the ſpirit our comforter himſelf, is <note place="margin">Eph. 1. 13</note> the <hi>ſpirit of promiſe, Epheſ.</hi> 1. 13. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in after ye beleeved, ye were ſealed with the spirit of promiſe,</hi> we are invited, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, to beleeve, by a promiſe, as ſo, in the form thereof, when we believe, we are Heires of the promiſe, that is, of the <hi>mattter</hi> thereof, then, we not able to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

               </p>
               <p>4. And laſtly, Why may not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes be the ordained means of <hi>comfort,</hi> as well as the meanes of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>1. Promiſes in their tender and offer are the only ordinary Goſpell way and meanes of incouraging and gaining ſinners to <hi>beleeve:</hi> The Law in a ſenſe may be ſaid to lead or rather to drive a Soul to Chriſt, but the Goſpell only <hi>(i)</hi> the tender of Chriſt in a promiſe, doth prevaile upon the Soule, to lay hold on him. The te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Goſpell being in a word but this, <hi>he that beleeveth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> The promiſe of ſalvation herein, upon this condition of faith, ſet home upon the Soule by the ſpirit of Chriſt, doth but <hi>reaſonably perſwaded</hi> it to beleeve for Salvation: And why not likewiſe to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi> in the evidence of faith, applying the promiſe, yea a Soule groaning under the weight and burden of ſin, muſt needs
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:114638:108"/> have ſome refreſhment, from the very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, much more application of the kindeneſſe of Chriſt, ſo ſweetly expreſſed in the inviting promiſe: <hi>Come unto me all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 11. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> That there is ſuch a pomiſe that gives any hopes of eaſe and reſt, it giveth ſurely ſome eaſe and comfort to a <hi>truly weary and heavy laden Soul,</hi> as it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth to come for it.</p>
               <p>But furthermore, is not a promiſe more naturall and proper, to comfort being <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,</hi> then to perſwade to beleeve being <hi>apprehended?</hi> For I may know of a certain that the promiſe of ſalvation belongeth to me after I have Faith, but not before: So muſt needs have more incouragement, for application of the promiſe for comfort When I do beleeve before; then by a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall propoſition to venter my ſelfe, for Faith. Yet as we have found, a tender of promiſe, by the bleſſing of haven is the only effectuall means of Faith.</p>
               <p>Secondly <hi>of holineſſe:</hi> Seeing <hi>we have</hi>

               <p> 
                  <hi>To us are given exceeding great and precious promiſes, that by theſe we might be</hi>

               <p>BUT we paſſe on from the <hi>way</hi> of the miniſtry, to that is moſt materiall, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Ordinances</hi> themſelves, the <hi>matter</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>The generall concluſion of theſe men againſt Ordinances is plainly this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thoſe forms that Christ appeared in, when</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Errour.</note> 
                  <hi>in the fleſh, are diſſolved &amp; ceaſe, at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the spirit.</hi> And they for their parts have received the comming of the Spirit, therefore all forms <hi>(i.)</hi> Ordinances ceaſe to them.</p>
               <p>The potent Scripture for this end and <note place="margin">the ground.</note> purpoſe, is, <hi>Revela.</hi> 21. 22, 23. <hi>And I ſaw no Temple therein: For the Lord God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty and the Lamb are the Temple thereof, and the City hath no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it: For the Glory of God did light it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.</hi> Hence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, they being in this City, therefore
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:114638:111"/> they have no Temple of Ordinances, no need of Sun or Moon, the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Lamb lighting them.</p>
               <p>But in anſwer hereunto, I ſhall, I hope, prove theſe two things. Eirſt, That this glorious City is not yet built. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That when this glorious day ſhall be, it ſhall not, probably, diſſolve or darken, but rather inlighten and certifie Goſpell Ordinances.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, to prove this glorious City, here mentioned, magnified, is not yet in the World. Some hold that it is the ſtate of the Church in Heaven; and that, upon ſuch like grounds as follow.

               <p> But we know, that the Judgement of God is according to truth, againſt them which commit ſuch things.

               <p>2.

               <p n="1">1. And firſt, This Scripture cannot poſſibly make void the preaching of the Word, if we conſider this following gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.
<list>
                     <item>1. That it is a branch of the Covenant of Grace.</item>
                     <item>2. Chriſt is the Mediatour and Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of it for us.</item>
                     <item>3. Chriſt promiſed the ſpirit for the ſame purpoſe, even to lead us into all truth.</item>
                     <item>4. That the ſame Chriſt, when he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, <note place="margin">Epheſ 4.</note> gave Miniſters alſo, for this ſame purpoſe.</item>
                     <item>5. At the ſame time, when as he aſcended to give theſe gifts, he ſent his ſpirit upon the ſame errand: And therefore not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to beat his fellow Servant, to josſle the Miniſter out of the World.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Now for the meaning of this place: In a word, it is either to be taken hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:114638:118"/> or comparatively, but mediately ſtil, or with <hi>Calvin,</hi> reſtraining the accent to theſe later words, <hi>ſaying, know the Lord:</hi> the meaning then being no more then this As the effect of the powring forth of the ſpirit, there ſhal be a general profeſſion of the name of God abroad, <hi>knowledge cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the earth as water doth the Seas,</hi> in a generall ſenſe <hi>of knowing the Lord.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>they ſhall not need every one to teach his Neighbour, ſaying, Know the Lord, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, ſaying, Know the Lord, for all ſhall know me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And therefore to conclude, the Text fore-mentioned, ſpeaks not <hi>the ministry</hi> null but effectuall: God will not take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way meanes but make meanes more proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous by a more eſpeciall preſence and help of his ſpirit, God will <hi>teach</hi> us by his Son: Chriſt will <hi>instruct</hi> us by his Spirit: And the ſpirit ſhall <hi>lead us into all</hi>

                  <hi>truth,</hi> by the faithfull miniſtry of the word. And obſerve, this Covenant was in force as well then as now: Then why <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note</hi> 1.</note> ſhould it null the preaching of the Word more now than then?</p>
               <p>2. The Miniſtry, therefore, was a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worker</hi> with God in that age, and why not now alſo?</p>

               <p>3. We may in the third place argue

               <p>And firſt, from the end of the Miniſtry, that is intrinſically in the nature of it; and what is that? namely <hi>Faith,</hi> for what doth naturally anſwer or receive a <hi>report</hi> (as the preaching of the Goſpell is) our <note place="margin">Iſa. 53. 1.</note> Faith or a beleeving of it.

               </p>
               <p>Be not deceived, for as the word revealeth Chriſt, ſo the Miniſtry of the word reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the word: As the word is the means
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:114638:124"/> of the knowledge of Chriſt, ſo preaching is the means of the knowledge of the word. The word, is the word of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> and <hi>the word of Reconciliation is committed to us.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. The calling of ſuch Miniſters, being received many yeares before they left <hi>Rome,</hi> might for any thing we know be received, when the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was a true Church, though extreamly corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For as ſoon as ever the Pope was the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> the <hi>Antichrist (i.)</hi> When his iniquity was ripe, may we not think, that God would not ſuffer his People or Miniſtry, much leſſe, any longer under him, but both called and brought them from under him; and then there is no difficulty left, but we have found and granted a ſucceſſion of Perſons in the Miniſtry of Chriſt from the Apoſtles times.</p>

               <p>2. When God denieth an ordinary way for things that he purpoſeth to continue, he himſelf ſupplieth extraordinarily: as he fed <hi>Elias,</hi> ſupplied the womans Bagg and Cruſe, and might doe here, <hi>viz.</hi> By the conſent of the Church, having all <note place="margin">Vox popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lt, vox Dei.</note> power radically in her, that Officers ſhould have even for Ordination, and in ſuch a caſe, the voice of the People is the
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:114638:126"/> voice of God: Again, it is granted by the very doubt, that there is, and muſt be a true Miniſtery ſome where; and urged by the Objection alſo, that the Miniſtery of <hi>Rome</hi> is Antichriſtian: Therefore the true Miniſtery muſt needs be with us, that is, the diſcenting, Reformed Churches: Let the way of Devolution, Derivation of it, be either extraordinary or ordinary, or whatſoever.</p>
               <p>2. But we ſhall add a few things more for ſatisfaction to the <hi>ſcruple, viz.</hi> To prove that the Miniſtery, of the Reformed Churches, and perticularly of <hi>England,</hi> is the Miniſtry of Chriſt. I mean not, every idle, blinde, and corrupt guid among us, but ſuch as be in life, Godly, and honeſt, in Labours abundant and faithfull among us, ſuch as theſe are truly ſent by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Therefore conſider, it being granted that there is, and hath been ſtill ſince the daies of the Apoſtles, a ſucceſſion of the Miniſtery of Chriſt, where ſhould it be? before God called us out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> it muſt be either in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or among the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Jews:</hi> The two later no Chriſtian, none will ſay that they had
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:114638:127"/> the Miniſtery of Chriſt, therefore it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the Miniſtery of Chriſt, before the reformation, was in <hi>Rome (i.)</hi> under the <hi>Romiſh</hi> power: But when we devided and abjured <hi>Rome</hi> as Antichriſtian: The true Miniſtery muſt be either with <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>us,</hi> that did diſcent from <hi>Rome,</hi> it is moſt unreaſonable, and a contradiction to ſay, that the true Miniſtery is with the falſe, and not with the true Church: Now if it be granted, (as it cannot with any kind of colour be denied) that when the people of God firſt came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they brought the true Miniſtery out along with them, it is moſt clear that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of <hi>England,</hi> hath had a Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moſt known and viſible from thoſe that firſt brake off from Antichriſt: Now the only difficulty is, whether we or thoſe that ſeperate from us, have this Bleſſing pleaded for; and it is cleer from what hath been juſt now ſaid, that we once had it, and it behoovs them to ſhew when and how we loſt it: But as for them that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate from us, tis very unlikely that the true Miniſtry ſhould be with them, for firſt none of their Preachers, at leaſt very few of them, in his great Harveſt, pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:114638:127"/> it; And again, their own pretences, or vain imaginations, would not create their lawfull call unto it: Which call conſiſts of two parts, <hi>viz.</hi> Qualification, and <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 2 <hi>Cap.</hi>
                  </note> Commiſſion: The firſt they only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they have, the laſt, they care not for.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Moreover we may prove the truth of our Miniſtry from the truth of its fruit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Effects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Our Saviour in giving us rules for the triall of Teachers, ſaith, By their <hi>Fruit</hi> ye ſhall know them.</p>
               <p>Their Fruit, that is, their Doctrine: you ſhall know them, that is, whether they be of God. If there be a Miniſtery of Chriſt in the World, where ſhould it be? but where the Doctrine and truth of Chriſt is taught? and though we cannot cleare a Succeſſion of perſons, yet doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs a Succeſſion of Doctrine, is in this ſenſe enough to clear the truth of our Miniſtery: We have the Doctrine of Chriſt truly preacht among us, I mean, the reformed Churches, above all other Churches in the World, and upon evident conſequence it follows, that we the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:114638:128"/> Churches, have a cleerer evidence of the truth of our miniſtery then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>2. From the Effects thereof, wrought by preaching in the hearts of the Hearers, cut off the Beams from the Sun, and they ceaſe any longer to be conveyances of light unto the World. And the Miniſtery cannot do the work of Chriſt, but as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon Chriſt, who are only <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by whom you beleeve, as God gave to every man.</hi> Now if the Miniſtry do the work of Chriſt, and this be only by the ſtrength and help of Chriſt, ſurely it is Chriſts Miniſtery; and it may ſay with the Apoſtle to all the true Converts in <hi>England,</hi> ye are the <hi>Seale</hi> and witneſs of our <hi>Apoſtleſhip,</hi> and call from Heaven, who have been owned and uſed by the hand of Omnipotency, in your ſpirituall Creation, Reſurrection, and Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: This reaſon may be by no means ſleighted: As to ſay, there were never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny truly converted among us by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the word, is againſt very ſenſe, and moſt uncharitable; ſo to deny the mean to be of God, is no leſſe then Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: To conclude, remember, that
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:114638:128"/> the ſeven Stars are in the hand of Chriſt, not only to be uſed, but kept by him: <note place="margin">Rev. 2. 1.</note> and his preſence is with us, not only to bleſſe our faithfull labours, but alſo to <note place="margin">Matth. 28. <hi>ult.</hi>

                  </label> After this vain manner, theſe men, while they walk upon the Battlements of heaven in their proud imaginations, they trample under foot this ſacred ordinance, as a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. Yea certainly Jeſus Chriſt (if there a thing as perfection here) had attained perfection juſt before his death, yet even then he findes occaſion to authorize the excellent practiſe of prayer by his own <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 1.</note> example: Jeſus ſpake theſe words, and lift up his eyes to Heaven, and ſaid, <hi>Father, &amp;c.</hi>

               </p>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:114638:133"/>
               <p> And as Prayer is of an eternall nature and power; and is only ſuſpended till oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion acts it: So every man alive, a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of this World, hath continuall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and occaſion thereof; and therefore every man alive have their warrant moſt ready for the practiſe of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
               <p>Now that every man alive hath occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and matter of prayer, will appear in the truth of theſe two propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That want or miſery of any kind whatſoever, is the proper and naturall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion and ſeaſon of Prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the beſt and moſt perfect of men in this life, are the Subjects of want or miſery, of one kinde or other, while they live in the World.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now for the firſt of theſe, becauſe the want of ſpirituall, Heavenly, things, as it is an occaſion of Prayer, is as leſſe doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo leſſe ſenſible alſo; we ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore demonſtrate that even earthly and temporall wants, are a fit and ſeaſonable occaſion of prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Even temporall bleſſings are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and therefore may, and muſt be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for. Godlineſſe having a <hi>Promiſe of,</hi>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:114638:133"/> and therefore, a <hi>Prayer</hi> for this life alſo. I will ſaith God, <hi>multiply the fruit of the</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eze. 36, 30. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>Tree, the increaſe of the Feild,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet for this will I be inquired of by the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raell to do it for them, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And therefore our Saviour, that was free from ſin, the moſt perfect of men, he prayeth, notwithſtanding, <hi>if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble let this Cup paſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. And as any miſery is the occaſion of prayer, ſo the beſt and perfecteſt of men alive, are ſubjects of miſery in one kinde or other; and leaſt men ſhould boaſt of perfection of Grace; though ſuch boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting is vain, yet we may infallibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of outward ſufferings, as lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them as to any others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore affording to them an equall occaſion and ſeaſon of Prayer, with others. They will not deny, that <hi>man that is born of a woman,</hi> let him be who he will, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, God himſelf, <hi>hath but a ſhort time to live and is full of miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yea and a man that is born of the ſpirit much more: <hi>For thoſe that will live God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Christ Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution:</hi> and here no argument will heal and help the men of this errour in this fruit, their
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:114638:134"/> rience viſible all the world over, diſcovers and proclaims their vanity and ſufferings; they being ſubject to greifs, ſickneſſes, wants, death, as well as other men. Now unleſſe they will maintain <hi>their Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is past</hi> before their death, one of their Paradoxes; how can they eſcape the dint of this argument, how can they put of the impetious motion of their wants and miſeries in their Freinds, themſelves, their Soules, Bodyes, Eſtates, Names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſtill reſiſt, and <hi>quench the ſpirit of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, We argue the warrant of this practiſe by all, from the principle of it, the <hi>Efficiens adjuvans,</hi> the aſſiſting, helping cauſe of prayer, the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, that prayer dependeth upon its occaſion and ſeaſon; and man in this life hath continuall occaſion and ſeaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and man is fooliſh and weak, and not able or wiſe of himſelf to improve this occaſion for this end and purpoſe; Gods Grace hath provided him, the Help and aſſiſtance of his own ſpirit to <hi>teach him</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>how to pray.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, to make it as cleer as the Sun, that
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:114638:134"/> the coming of the ſpirit, doth not put to ſilence, but rather raiſe and elevate the voice of prayer: we conſider him, 1. In his promiſe. 2. in his Office.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In his promiſe, and we read many pregnant promiſes of the ſpirit and of its abundant powrings forth, eſpecially at the famous converſion of the Jews to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the later ages of the World: The great queſtion is, what will be the manner and effects of his coming? from ſome generall diſcriptions thereof, ſome men, as our Antagoniſts; imagine, that ſuch ſhall be the powring forth of the ſpirit then, as that he ſhall drown and waſh off from the earth all former Ordinances of the Church, and this of praier among the reſt, but as we defended the reſt in their place, ſo here we ſhall read upon that promiſe in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. 10. Which declareth after this manner the ſpirit ſhall come, in the <note place="margin">Zach. 12. 10.</note> plentifulleſt powrings forth thereof, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at his moſt glorious coming upon the new <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> With relation to the duty in hand, <hi>Prayer:</hi> Let us read to be ſatisfied, I will power upon the Houſe of <hi>David</hi> and the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Grace and Supplications: this will
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:114638:135"/> releive ſome light more, if compared with that of <hi>Eze.</hi> 36. where having firſt laid down a moſt large deſcription of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, which will not be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or fully performed till the powrings of the ſpirit, upon this Houſe of <hi>David</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> all is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with this, yet the ſpirit I have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red upon you, as a ſpirit of ſupplication, ſhall make you pray for what I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed; <hi>yet for all this will I be inquired of by the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, &amp;c. Not that we imagine that the Sun of this ſpirit is thus full riſen upon any among us, do we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue; but for the conviction of the folly of ſuch, as upon ſuch a ſuppoſition, have denied themſelves of the benefit and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe of prayer. They have only the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe of caſting away prayer, and not the fullneſſe of the coming of that Spirit that is even then in its fulneſſe a <hi>ſpirit of Grace and Supplication.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Let us conſider the ſpirit of God in its office alſo: And we ſhall finde that it is not ſealed, to diſſolve, but indeed appointed to uphold, yea perform this duty of prayer, in us and for us; its Office is (anſwerable to his name) ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:114638:135"/> performed, in <hi>bearing up our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 26.</note> teaching us what to ask, yea and by making interceſſion or praying in us. Is the Hoaſt or the Kingdome of Heaven then, devided? is the ſpirit his comming, to teach us what to ask and yet to put an end to the duty of prayer? help <hi>Oedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> But if any interpoſe, that the ſpirit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. is ſaid to pray in us which may bear an immediate interceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God for us, without the means or uſe of our hearts or mouths; I anſwer, that according to, and in the very ſame Text, verſe, there are two ſufficient Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to detect and prevent ſuch a fond E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaiſion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The ſpirit is ſaid <hi>to help our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> intimating, that we are the <hi>Subjects</hi> or undertakers of Prayer, but indeed we being weak and inſufficient for it, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is to <hi>help</hi> and aſſiſt us in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is alſo ſaid to make interceſſion in us with groanes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> implying thereby, that the ſpirit doth not pray <hi>in</hi> us only, but <hi>by</hi> us alſo.</p>
               <p>The ſpirit being no waies capable in it ſelf of groaning, it intercedeth in and by
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:114638:136"/> our groanes: We being only capable of groanes, that are capable of the feeling of thoſe heavy miſeries that are prayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt.</p>
               <p>It being high time I end, having ſet the Seale of the ſpirit to the warrant of the duty of Prayer, <hi>my ſpirit alſo making Interceſſion both for the duty and the Oppoſers thereof, with groanes unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. But as I have been large in warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the practiſe, ſo might I be much more large in preſſing the duty of Prayer.</p>
               <p>It being as <hi>good</hi> as <hi>true,</hi> as uſefull as lawfull, yea moſt neceſſary (which I ſhall only touch with that uſuall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of neceſſity and leave) and that.</p>
               <p n="1">1. With a neceſſity of command; We have not time, ſcarce Arethmetick, to reckon up and ſet down how many ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall times, this exerciſe of prayer is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in ſcripture; which, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority <note place="margin">Phil. 4. 7. 1 Theſ. 5. 17.</note> of one only, is made not only to be no ſin, but a duty alſo. In every ſtrait, at all times, in all ages <hi>Pray;</hi> in <hi>every thing make known your request unto God.</hi> And <hi>pray continually.</hi> Now doth any man
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:114638:136"/> plead that this duty or command, is of no force to him, I demand where, when, and of whom hath he had a diſpenſation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from? neither can the power or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof be weakned by extinction, for the want of occaſion: Every man alive, having, while alive here, ſome croſſe, ſome want, or other as hath been largely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated before. And to want and the Croſſe, is prayer ſtill nailed and joyned, or injoyned rather upon ſuch as ſuffer them; if any man <hi>lack</hi> let him <hi>ask</hi> of God <note place="margin">Jam. 1. 5.</note> that giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Prayer is neceſſary with a neceſſity of means alſo. And it is indeed both a <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall</hi> and a <hi>Religious</hi> means of good to us: The firſt, we heretofore have cleered, and the later appears, in that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Goſpell <hi>command,</hi> but ſuch, as is ſtill incouraged, and followed with the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of a gracious <hi>Promiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prayer, it was the Ladder by which our Saviour himſelf muſt clime, and aſcend to <note place="margin">Pſal. 2. 8.</note> his Kingdome and Glory: <hi>Ask of me,</hi> ſaith God unto him, and I <hi>will give thee the Heathen for thine Inheritance, and the uttermoſt part of the earth for thy poſſeſſion:</hi>
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:114638:137"/> It is the <hi>Rope</hi> whereby he alſo <hi>draweth</hi> us up after him, that <hi>where he is we may be alſo:</hi> So prayeth he that ever liveth to make interceſſion for us, <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me</hi> be with me where I am, that they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Glory which thou haſt given <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 24</note> me.</p>
               <p>Prayer is that whereby <hi>we</hi> alſo cry <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba Father;</hi> and receive from his hands, both the generall and particuler bleſſings of <hi>Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In generall, Prayer is the Sword in our hand that <hi>cutteth</hi> off the head of the <hi>beaſt Babilon,</hi> being <hi>drowned</hi> in the <hi>Sea</hi> of tears, and the great <hi>Whore burnt</hi> in the <hi>Zeale</hi> of cries. Prayer with the ſtrength of its importunity breaks the Heavens, ſo that the <hi>Glory</hi> of God may diſcend upon his Church, and make it the praiſe and <hi>beauty</hi> of the World. Yea, and haſtens the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous marriage-day betwixt the Lamb and the Lambs wife; as we prize thoſe things, let us practiſe Prayer, joyning therein, with glorified Martyrs, Apoſtles, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, even Heaven and Earth, and ſay, <note place="margin">Rev. 6. 10. Iſa. 62 1. 2.</note>

               </p>
               <p>And all particular private mercies are to be handed by prayer alſo; it being a means, not only of our own but our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours good; not only of temporall, but ſpirituall and Heavenly Mercies al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.</p>

               <p>WE have hitherto indeavored, that the ſpirit might owne his owne effects, Cauſe, word, and Miniſtry: And it followeth laſtly, that we reconcile him to the knowledge and acknowledgment of his owne former Seale and witneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> in our <hi>Experiences.</hi> The errour is, that <hi>all the experiences that we have had of God</hi>

               </p>

His meaning is, when he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth that our deliverances may be either <hi>true or falſe,</hi> that for any thing we can know, they may be either, or as well falſe as true; and therefore we can build no infallible aſſurance of Gods Love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; ſince the knowledge with reſpect to the evidence thereof is fallible.</p>
               <p>Again, hence then there will ariſe a double queſtion. 1.

To the Author of deliverance, and is, whether we can poſſibly know, whether our deliverance be wrought <hi>by God,</hi> or no; <hi>(i.)</hi> by Satan or our ſelves.</p>
               <p>1. Firſt, Then let us examine whether we may know the truth and reality of our deliverance: And to this I anſwer, what
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:114638:140"/> ſhould hinder us, if the ſpirit of God aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt us? can any thing be more knowable to the Soul then its own actions and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? if I know any thing, do not I know that I know it? if I love any thing, do not I know that I love it? if I hate any thing do not I know that I hate it? can there be any reall change within me, eſpecially more then ordinary, any motion, alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, converſion, more then ordinary, and I know it not? but what is more ſenſible then the deliverance from under the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of <hi>the Lordly power of corruption</hi> (to uſe one of his own inſtances. For this ſame purpoſe) then the cutting off a right hand, plucking out of a right eye, the mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a beloved luſt; what is more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then the peace of God paſſing all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, when delivered from a troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, vexed and tormented conſcience? what more perceiveable then, then joy unſpeakable and full of Glory to me?</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> But the very heart and core of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, that is ſo hard to be gotten out, it is, <hi>viz.</hi> that Hypocrites do think their deliverance as true and firm as the beſt.</p>

                  </label> I anſwer, this is not denied; and yet this as I have ſhewed before, cannot a jot
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:114638:140"/> make a true Chriſtians evidence fallible: or the knowledge of his true deliverance, weak and deceiveable. The Reaſon is plain, for though a man in the dark, or blind, may eaſily be deceived, yet a man that hath his eyes in his head indubitab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth what he ſeeth or feeleth. A man a ſleep, may dream and phanſy to himſelf that he hath full Barns, ful Cheſts, full Tables, all the ground and matter and occaſion of joy imaginable: But though this man doth but dream, and is deceived, cannot another that hath theſe things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be aſſured thereof? ſhall another mans lie make my truth of none effect? becauſe ſome menare dead, are there none that know themſelves alive? ſome blind, do none ſee, and know they ſee? becauſe the half recovered blind man in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, ſaw men as Trees, ſhould this make the ſtanders by, queſtion, whether they did indeed ſee men or no? yea, could they not be aſſured thereof, becauſe of his doubting? we that are delivered out of the <hi>Powers of darkneſſe, we have our eyes ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and are in marvelous light;</hi> beſides, and can we ſee no more then ſuch as are blind and in the dark? then Hypocrites? our
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:114638:141"/> eyes being opened and we ſeeing in Gods light, having received the ſpirit to this end <hi>that we know the things that are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to us of God,</hi> why may not we <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 1, 2.</note> know, and give thanks with St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Colloſſians; for that he hath delivered us</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Col. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>out of the powers of darkneſs into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Son of his love.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwer, that if the truth of the deliverance, being, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, be known, this cannot be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For if I am truly delivered from the dominion of any ſin; this cannot be from Satan, who wants both will and power, to ſuch a holy work: If it be of my ſelf it can onely be by Chriſt his aſſiſtance, <hi>ſevened from whom we can do nothing;</hi> ſo that we <note place="margin">John 15.</note> muſt of neceſſity conclude that in <hi>the ſtrength of the Lord we have done valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Lord is our ſtrength and our redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer:</hi> Eſpecially being inlightned with the knowledge of the premiſes, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to lay down the concluſion, by the ſpirit of Chriſt, that is as <hi>fire</hi> that hath not only heat to <hi>conſume</hi> our corruption, but <hi>light</hi> to <hi>manifest</hi> the World to be
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:114638:141"/> done, and by whom it is done likewiſe. And did not the Prophets of old, without doubt beleeve that their Dreams and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were from God? did not <hi>Paul</hi> know that his calling and Apoſtleſhip, was of the Lord? and the primitive Chriſtians? were they not aſſured that they received the Holy Ghoſt? even ſo we, the Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Lord may infallibly know, that the Lord <hi>is our Rock and our Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer. And though the whole World lieth in wickedneſſe, yet we are of God:</hi> And that the things, we have received <hi>are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to us of God.</hi> And therefore this renewing of this Argument here, hath but offered an occaſion, of diſcovering its rottenneſſe, more and more; and not in the leaſt darkned the evidence of our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And firſt of all it is worth our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, that the own experience of thoſe men hath uſually been their ſtrongeſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in other points, though here they diſpute againſt <hi>experience,</hi>

               <p>2. Yet what more cleerer and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:114638:142"/> way of arguing, then from <hi>experience</hi> it is therfore called the Miſtres of fools, it makes them underſtand and be wiſe. It is not a naturall Dictate, <hi>Maxime, viz. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perientia docet,</hi> yet Chriſtians may not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve or gather any thing from their <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences:</hi> How unnaturall, unreaſonable is their Religion. Do we not, yea, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of reaſon, muſt we not <hi>judge</hi> of men as we <hi>finde</hi> them? we will firſt <hi>try,</hi> and then <hi>trust,</hi> and is God more <hi>variable</hi> and man more <hi>conſtant?</hi> dare we venter our credit upon the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of men, and yet not of God? O let God be <hi>true</hi> and every man <hi>a Liar:</hi> Let man be changeable, but God <hi>be God that changeth not, even the ſame yeſterday to day and for ever.</hi> O let the Method and order of Gods Creation and Government, the courſ of his daily providence, ſpeak, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for him: And perſwade us to beleeve that he is faithfull to his own Rules, and to his ſervants truſt: that he is conſtant &amp; the ſame, with whom is <hi>no variablenes nor ſhadow of turning:</hi> &amp; that what you found him hitherto, either to his Freinds or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, even ſuch you will finde him ſtill, <hi>the Heavens declare the Glory of God and</hi>

                  <hi>the Firmament ſheweth his handy works;</hi> but thoſe experiences that come in the <hi>Fathers name,</hi> that they may fare no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the <hi>Son,</hi> you will not beleeve, but <note place="margin">Joh. 5. ult.</note> others that come in <hi>their own name, them ye will beleeve.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Do we not argue the love and good will of men by their gifts; eſpecially in want? from their help an aſſiſtance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in ſtraits? yet though God hath been a <hi>preſent help in time of trouble to us:</hi> though he hath in the midſt of extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt want moſt conſtantly and ſeaſonably ſtill ſupplied us, though he ſatisfied and conquered all our doubts and dangers for us: Yet we may not, we muſt not beleeve that he did thoſe things out of any love he bore to us; we may not for future, put any truſt and confidence in him, upon this incouragement: Nor looke upon our ſelves to be ſafe, under that protection, that hath hitherto been as Wals and Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks to us. Moſt ſtrange and ureaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Doctrine, moſt wickedly ungratefull practiſe! <hi>is his hand ſhortned that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſave ſtil,</hi> or <hi>his ear</hi> that was open, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, <hi>that it cannot heare?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. And as the way of this errour
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:114638:143"/> thwarts reaſon and experience, ſo it doth flatly contradict the authority of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this particuler; which ſpeaketh it expreſly, <hi>that experience worketh Hope.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ro. 5. 4. 5.</note> Experience and hope are mutually a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall cauſe, and effect, it being the proper nature thereof, to produce and to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. He adds that <hi>Hope maketh not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> (i.) <hi>giveth great boldneſſe, becauſe thereby the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost.</hi> Thus we ſee then that the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> or the comming of the Spirit, doth not make null the uſe of <hi>experience,</hi> but rather makes uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for the working of hope, that by hope he might ſhed the love of God abroad in our hearts, and give us great boldneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt future ſufferings.</p>
               <p>In this very place, we may read the uſe of Experience now pleaded for, to be the truth of ſcripture, ſeconded by reaſon, ſtrengthned by the ſpirit; and all ſet down as the Saints experience alſo.</p>
               <p>2. Moreover no argument in ſcripture is more frequent and potent for the raiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of the hopes and the hearts of Gods Children then this of experience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have the ſtrength of <hi>Davids</hi> Lion and

               </p>
               <p>3. May not we ſay with one breath, that he <hi>is the Author and Finiſher of our</hi>

And then, why doth the ſpirit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us here not to beleeve every ſpirit? much more, what need of <hi>triall of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?</hi> or any marks or outward rules, <note place="margin">Ver. 1. 2. 3. 6.</note> whereby we might know <hi>the ſpirit of truth and the ſpirit of Errour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Text is thus far moſt cleer to all, that the ſpirit that dictates to, or dweleth in us <hi>may be true or falſe,</hi> for ought we know until we <hi>try</hi> and examine it by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means. Is it anſwered that thus it is knowable? ſo is the work thereof in our hearts, are they not known to be true or falſe but by the light of the ſpirit through our examining? no more is the ſpirit himſelf. Which it acknowledged, to be knowable to us in the uſe of means by his own light; we are agreed, But this you may not allow, that deny and oppoſe by the ſame (pretended) <hi>ſpirit, all means of tryall; your errour and miſery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Secondly, And doth not right rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon alſo ſet to its Seal that this is true? for thus I argue.</p>
               <p>1. Where the truth of the effect can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cannot
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:114638:147"/> be diſcerned without light from the cauſe, how ſhal the truth of the cauſe be diſcerned, without help from the effect, now as to the caſe in hand, it is received by all hands, that the truth of the effect, to wit <hi>Grace;</hi> cannot be known but by the light of the cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſpirit.</p>
               <p>And the conſequence is cleer from this common truth, the effect is more knowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then the cauſe: The reaſon thereof is, for that the effect is more obvious to ſenſe then the cauſe, and things are conveyed by ſenſe into the <hi>underſtanding:</hi> for look how much the more, any thing hath, <hi>de ratione objecti, viz. of ſenſe,</hi> it is ſo much the more eaſily diſcerned; again, that that is farther off from our knowledg; is uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argued by that, that is neerer and more known to us; as we uſually gain acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with ſtrangers, by the means of our knowledge and acquaintance before. Now according to theſe rules, ſince the effects of the ſpirit are neerer to our knowledge, then the ſpirit it ſelf, and yet we are not able to diſcern the true effects of the ſpirit without the ſpirits aſſiſtance; how can we then be poſſibly, at leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably able, to make the truth of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:114638:148"/> indubitable to us, without regard to its Effects, without uſe of means?</p>
               <p>Secondly, It ſeems to appeare, that the <note place="margin">The ſecond way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing.</note> ſpirit as alone without the uſe of any means, and conſidered abſtractedly from its effects, cannot be known to be true or falſe, from the conſideration of the nature of ſpirits in generall.</p>
               <p>Spirits are knowable to men in their <hi>Eſſence, reſidence, and quality.</hi> With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect indeed to the firſt of theſe, we may know them, both that they are, and what they are, as by way of <hi>Negation,</hi> ſo by way of <hi>eminence;</hi> but with reſpect to their place of reſidence and qualities, where they are, and what ones they are, whether true or falſe, good or bad, we can know them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by way of cauſality: or by their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſymptomes, effects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, for in order hereunto, we can only judg of them, by ſenſe or reaſon, the only principles competent to man, of knowledge and diſcerning.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let us examine, whether ſpirits either in their <hi>where, or kind,</hi> are to be known by ſenſe or reaſon immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately without ſome ſigne, effect, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <pb n="271" facs="tcp:114638:148"/>
               <p> 2. For there <hi>where</hi> or place of abode, this certainly cannot be diſcerned imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by <hi>ſenſe:</hi> Spirits being no ſenſible Objects, imagine what kinde of ſpirit you will, whether it be Angelicall, rationall, animall, much more divine, and though things of a groſſer ſubſtance, <hi>viz.</hi> Bodies may, yet the ſpirit cannot <hi>Propter ejus exceſſum,</hi> or by reaſon of its excelling pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, be thus diſcovered. We may take up a little of the knowledg of ſpirits, for our preſent purpoſe, from the pureſt of Bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> Fire, though Fire as corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted may, and is, yet fire in its Element cannot be ſeen (and as ſome affirm) nor felt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore our daily experience ſheweth us, that the fire with us, ſo ſoon as ever it hath conquered and overcome its matter, gotten out of the cage, the flame, that thickned it, it is immediatly inviſible, if not inſenſible; and though it paſſeth upward towards its center and Element before our eyes, yet who can perceive it? now ſpirits, the groſſeſt of ſpirits are ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to fire not only in degree, but kinde alſo. and that, that elevateth the pureſt fire, to exceed our ſenſes, <hi>viz.</hi> its purity, is far more eminently contained in ſpirits
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:114638:149"/> and is the very thing that gives ſpirits their name, and the very name, that puts a diſtinction betwixt them and bodies, the pureſt of Bodies, <hi>fire</hi> it ſelf. It is a thing moſt apparant to experience, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know whence any ſpirit is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately by ſenſe, for wherein can they be ſenſible. They have no <hi>colour,</hi> therefore inviſible: They are not <hi>Bodies</hi> therefore not audible: <hi>They have no ſenſible quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not cold, hot, dry, moist,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cannot be ſmelt, felt, or taſted. Therefore we read that when Angells were ſent to accompany men, they still aſſumed bodies according to ſcripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly now ſince the preſence of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, is not knowable, diſcernable, by ſenſe there is no other way left for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, but by reaſon: Angells in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſee and know <hi>intuitive,</hi> but this way of knowledge, doth not <hi>Competere</hi> with us <hi>men:</hi> We are reaſonable creatures and know and judge of things, not obvious to ſenſe, by our reaſons only. But let us be our ſelves and ſeriouſly conſider and how is it poſſible, that we, that are reaſonable Creatures, ſhould judge of the preſence of any thing not obvious to our ſenſes,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:114638:149"/> without an exerciſe of reaſon about ſome <hi>effects, ſignes, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Moreover, if we cannot diſcern the preſence of ſpirits either by our ſenſe or reaſon, how much leſſe ſhal we ever be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge aright of their nature, kinde, or qualities, without regard to their <hi>Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,</hi> without uſe and help of ſome ſigne, mean, Companion or other thereof. As for example, how ſhall I know whether the ſpirit in thee, be <hi>rationall</hi> or <hi>animall</hi> onely: But becauſe it acteth a humane form or figure of Body in <hi>generall?</hi> Becauſe it diſcovereth it ſelf, by rationall diſcourſe more <hi>ſpeciall:</hi> Giving ſome ſigne or <hi>Effect</hi> or other, what ſpirit it is?</p>
               <p>Further, how ſhall I know whether the ſpirit in any, be weak, ſimple, or of ripe underſtanding, but by ſome outward o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations and fruits thereof? How do we try a mans <hi>Perſon?</hi> whether good or bad but by his <hi>Actions? The Tree</hi> (as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hath taught us) <hi>being known by his fruit,</hi> by their <hi>fruit ye ſhall know them:</hi> Yea nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer yet, a man may moſt eaſily miſtake, through ſelf-conceit and flattery in the knowledg and Judgment of his own ſpirit, imagining himſelf to be informed, acted,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:114638:150"/> and guided by a diſcreet wiſe and upright ſpirit, when indeed there is no ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: unleſſe he be ſo wiſe as to take a true meaſure for his knowledge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by comparing himſelf with ſuch rules and patterns, as are fit and known, for a Foole may be wiſe in his own conceit.</p>
               <p>But (to apply) if it be a thing ſo diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to know our own, ſo impoſſible to know anothers ſpirit, how improbable it is then that we ſhould be able to diſcern be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the ſpirit of God and the ſpirit of Satan without the help of ſome <hi>Effect</hi> or ſign or other, let a man of reaſon judge. 3. Things eſpecially do make this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, more difficult, this impoſſibility more impoſſible then the reſt. The</p>
               <p>Firſt reſpects the nature of God himſelf, and is, its tranſcendent purity: In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon whereof all other ſpirits, are to be imagined even as Bodies. The ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from this, and is, the diſtance there is betwixt our capacity and nature and this infinite purity, and the laſt is from the unconceivable ſubtilty of Satan, <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging himſelf into an Angell of light: who in his very miniſters, would deceive if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible the very Elect, and whoſe Ministers</hi>
                  <pb n="275" facs="tcp:114638:150"/> 
                  <hi>themſelves as our Saviour warneth cannot be diſcovered but by their fruits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And let us be aſſured that if the <hi>good ſpirit</hi> will perſwade us of the truth of it ſelf without tryal, much more wil the <hi>evil Truth ſeeks no Corners,</hi> but the deceiver the Prince of the powers of darkneſſe, he <hi>hates the light becauſe his deeds are evill.</hi> and dare not come to tryall.</p>

               <p>As there is very much reaſon againſt, ſo truly I know, no Text of ſcripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible for it. Firſt, reaſon ſeemeth to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt it; and firſt.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The perfection of man was this, <hi>viz.</hi> his body being every way ſubject; no way an impediment to his ſoule; from this man fell by ſin, and by grace, he is to this <note place="margin">

If wee ſhall be, continue to be men, when in Heaven, I ſubmit, but I cannot imagine, that then we ſhall ever enjoy ſuch a viſion as this: Can a reaſonable creature know, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and not by reaſon?

               <p>This is therefore the concluſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

               <p>Again, there is a greater diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and our intellect, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt

               <p>The firſt will not be ſtrictly granted for then: himſelf hath largely proved that our reaſonable ſoules as they are fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to inform our Bodies, can onely ſee and know by a converſion of things

                  </note> as to ſee the Eſſence of God or Angells; therefore he here doth admit that God cannot poſſibly be immediately ſeen in his Eſſence by any ſimilitude, had or received in a created intellect. and that whatſoever other form (except God onely) the underſtanding is informed, it cannot be poſſibly led thereby into the divine Eſſence.</p>
               <p>But therefore, it is ſaid that God ſeeth himſelf in us.

Then I demand whether God ſhall ſee himſelf in us and with us, or in us and without us: Whether he will make uſe of our principles or Faculty, or not.</p>
               <p>If the firſt of theſe be choſen, <hi>viz.</hi> That God in heaven wil make uſe of our Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the eye of our reaſon and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and only give us a cleerer light, and a higher uſe of our ſelves by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate dwelling in us; for this great bleſſed ſight, <hi>Viz.</hi> Of his own Eſſence: I anſwer that as God doth not cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell

               <p>2. Moreover, as God cannot make a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Creature to be reaſonable, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to act, but the Creature muſt leave its former form, and become a creature of another kind; even ſo how can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God ſhould make man to act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove its kind, man whoſe form is reaſon, to ſee and know things by inlightning and heightning his principles, that are not knowable by reaſon; yet man be man, <note place="margin">

               <p>2.

               <p>Secondly, If God doth ſee himſelf in us, and not by us; it muſt either be as he is our form, or not our form. The later, (if he ſee himſelf in us, and not by our eys not through thoſe faculties we had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nor as he is a new form as a new eye or new faculty to us) maketh this his ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himſelf in us, nothing to us.</p>
               <p>That cannot be a beatificall viſion to us, which is not our ſight; thus God ſeeth himſelf in every, the moſt ſtupid, yea and moſt miſerable Creature.</p>

               <p>But to conclude, and to ſpeak all in a word, could we imagine ſuch a thing, as that the Eſſence of God ſhould be the form of the Soule of man; doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore inevitably follow, that the Soul of man muſt ſee and know God in his Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? <hi>The Soul of man is the form of the Body, yet doth not the Body therefore ſee the ſoule, yea nor yet the Soul ſee its own Eſſence.</hi>

               <p>This Expoſition is ſtrongly confirmed by that expreſſion before, <hi>viz.</hi> When he ſhall appear: who? why ſurely Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the whole Analogy of the Goſpell, Which ſpeaks ſo much, for the exerciſe of Faith and hope, concerning the <hi>appearance</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, even every where, as alſo by that other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               </p>
               <p>The expoſition before mentioned, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us to conſtrue al this by compariſon, <hi>(i.)</hi> in compariſon of what we ſee now.

               <p>But ſecondly, there is to be obſerved a conſiderable difference betwixt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts the ſpirit giveth us, and the aſsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance we give or gain to our ſelves of the truth of the ſpirit; is the ſpirits ability the meaſure of ours? yea is it not far more difficult, to work aſſurance out of doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, then comfort from aſsurance?

The ſpirit cannot inlighten our hearts but by our reaſon, though he be a light, he can not be an eye or faculty to us: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot immediately comfort us. If we take ſuggeſtions upon truſt how ſhall our reaſon be ſanctified? and if our reaſon be not, our conſcience can never be ſatisfied; and then how weak how ſuperficiall our comfort, and how unworthy to be owned by the ſpirit of God our comforter? or to be called that <hi>Peace of God</hi> which keeps <note place="margin">Phil. 4</note> our <hi>hearts and minds</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
               <p>4. We are apt to imagine and miſtake a flaſh of our own ſpirits, which may be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by many unknown &amp; ſecret ways to be the unſpeakable raviſhing comforts of the ſpirit of God: ſenſitive joy, to be

               </p>
               <p>But ſecondly, Let us conſider how the preſence of our Freind doth comfort us. Either becauſe he is preſent or becauſe he is our Freind, both: how do we know he is preſent but by the means of ſeeing him? and how do we know that he is our freind
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:114638:163"/> but becauſe of our experience in the Effects of his freindſhip, and comforts immediate after this manner, we grant, are attainable, by the preſence of our freind, the ſpirit, <hi>viz.</hi> By aſsurance of its freindſhip, by true experience of, as alſo of its preſence by due reaſoning about the <hi>Effects</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>3. But now unleſs thou try, for ought either I or thy ſelf can know, thy ſpirit may be falſe as well as true; thy joy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit as well as reall?</p>
